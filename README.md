# meow-bot
a mastodon bot that meows in an interval between one minute and one hour.

feel free to fork it, host it yourself etc.
Only rules are: do not make damage with it and have fun with it 

## requierments 
nodeJs
npm

npm install axion

## additonal node
tried to improve the code so it runs more ressource efficent, but still not sure about that.

# Usage
install every requierment, then clone the repository, get everything out of the zip file and then with node index.js it will start. but i recommend using a process manager to not restart always the script.
Feel free to change stuff and also improve it.
